## 🚀 Namaste React – Complete Learning Journey

This repository documents my **complete React learning journey** inspired by  
**Namaste React by Akshay Saini**.

The goal of this repo is to build **strong React fundamentals**, understand **React internals**, and create **production‑ready applications**.

This monorepo contains my code for different episodes / milestones. For example, the `E03-Foundation` folder is a complete mini‑app built while learning JSX, components, routing, and Tailwind CSS.

## 📌 Course Philosophy

> “Don’t learn React, understand React.” – *Akshay Saini*

This journey focuses on:
- 🧠 **Deep fundamentals**
- ❓ Understanding **why** before **how**
- ⚙️ **React internals & performance**
- 🧑‍💻 **Real‑world projects**
- 🎯 **Interview‑oriented learning**

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **React** (Functional Components & Hooks)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Parcel** as the bundler (for now; may explore Vite later)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React Router DOM** for routing
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Jest** & **React Testing Library** for testing

---

## 🗂️ Folder Structure (High‑Level)

- `E03-Foundation/` – Food Ordering App built while learning JSX, components, hooks, routing, and Tailwind.
- `node_modules/` – Auto‑generated dependencies.
- `package.json` – Project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.

> As I progress through the course, more episode‑wise folders and features will be added.
