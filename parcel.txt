1. Dev Build => Parcel creates fast builds while you are developing your project so you can test things quickly.

2. Local Server => Parcel automatically starts a small local server (like http://localhost:1234) to run your project.

3. HMR – Hot Module Replacement => Whenever you change your code, the browser updates automatically.Sometimes it even updates without refreshing the whole page.
This makes development super fast.

4. File Watching Algorithm (written in C++) => Parcel uses a very fast file-watching system (built in C++).If you change a file → it instantly detects it → and rebuilds.

5. Caching – Faster Buildsn => Parcel stores previous build results in a cache.
Next time the build becomes much faster.

6. Image Optimization => Parcel automatically compresses and optimizes images without reducing quality.

7. Minification => It makes your code smaller by removing unnecessary spaces, comments, etc.
This helps your website load faster.

8. Bundling => Parcel combines all your JavaScript, CSS, etc. into bundles.

9. Compression => It compresses your bundles even more (like gzip/brotli) for faster loading.

10. Consistent Hashing => Parcel generates unique hashes for files so the browser knows when a file is updated.Helps with caching.

11. Code Splitting => It splits your code into smaller chunks.
Only the needed chunk loads first → faster page load.

12. Differential Bundling => Parcel creates different bundles for older and newer browsers so your app works everywhere.

13. Diagnostics => Parcel gives clean, easy-to-understand error messages.

14. Error Handling => It handles errors well and shows helpful messages.

15. HTTPS => You can even run your local server in HTTPS mode.

16. Tree Shaking => Parcel removes unused code automatically to make your bundle smaller.

17. Separate Dev & Prod Bundles => Parcel creates a different build for development and production (optimized and minified).
